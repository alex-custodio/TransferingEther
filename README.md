# TransferingEther
Here comes my project to improve my web3j skills, in this repo I will try to make a simple ether transaction

## Tools
+ Java
+ Gradle
+ Web3j 
+ IntelliJ

## How it works: 
The main code is on src/main/java folder and I called it Transaction.java. The code makes a simple ether transaction (I tested this using Ganache and it helped me a lot). 
+ 1 - I created the Web3j object, that works like a client and it gives us the access to the power of creating a transaction. 
+ 2 - After I made the GAS_PRICE, GAS_LIMIT, RECIPIENT (which contains the public address of who will receive the ether), and PRIVATE_KEY. 
+ 3 - So it is easy to use the private key to create the credentials and with those credentials we can make the core of a transaction.
+ 4 - I think the code is easy to read so if you try to review you will get it.


I would never have made it without: [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ905hVbQ_E&list=PL16WqdAj66SCOdL6XIFbke-XQg2GW_Avg&index=32)
